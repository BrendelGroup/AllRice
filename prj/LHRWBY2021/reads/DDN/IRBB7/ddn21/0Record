# Let's check that the sum total of IRBB7ddn21-mergedreads* entries is what we expect:
#
wc -l DIR*/IRBB7ddn21-mergedreads*
perl -e "print 8 * 20877780"
# ... checks out! (the total should be 8 times the number of sequences in each of *fa files)

# The summary shows how the surviving reads from the Trimmomatic step are further filtered
# to select "good" read pairs that overlap such that the left-unique, overlap, and
# right-unique regions are each at least 40 nt long (the expectation by library design is
# that left and right reads are each 250 nt long and overlap by 100 nt):
