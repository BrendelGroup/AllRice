# RNA-Seq read files of rice IRBB7 received from Dr. Bing Yang

# raw/*fq.gz:   ... original reads
# qtrl/*/*fq:   ... reads remaining after quality control

# C (control)  = L1.1-a and L1.1-b: IRBB7 transfected with mock vectors that contain no avrXA7 gene
# P (positive) = L1.2 and L2.2:     IRBB7 transfected with vectors that contain wt avrXA7 gene able to activate the Xa7 related gene expression
# M (mutant)   = L1.3 and L2.3:     IRBB7 transfected with vectors that contain mutant avrXA7 gene unable to activate the Xa7 related gene expression
