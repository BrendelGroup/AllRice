#Complete GoRAMPAGE run on IRRB7 RAMPAGE reads versus IRBB7 genome
#
#! Run the following first to switch to FROMSCRATCH mode - which starts with the
#  raw reads from the sequencing facility - from the default DOWNLOAD mode, which
#  uses the cleanned-up reads deposited at NCBI:
#
#	sed -i -e 's#MODE="DOWNLOAD"#MODE="FROMSCRATCH"#' xrunme xsetup TSR/0Record

#xsetup		- run this first to prepare for:

#xrunme		- the script to produce the alignment data in results/alignment 


#Record of data work:
